# Transport network visualisation hackathon


# Introduction

This will be an informal hackathon on generating, modelling and
modifying geographic representations of transport networks.

The hackathon will be held on Thursday 19th September (TBC) from 11:00
to 17:00.

# Aim

The aim of the hackathon is to bring people working on and with an
interest in visualising transport networks together to develop new and
evolvingideas, techniques and tools.

# Agenda

The event will be split into 2 parts: demo of existing tools plus
sharing of ideas and the hackathon itself. The rough timings will be as
follows (these can be adjusted on the day):

- 11:00 - 12:00: Demo of existing tools and sharing of ideas

  - 11:00 - 11:15: Demo of `parenx` Python package for network
    simplification (Will Deakin)
  - 11:15 - 11:30: Demo 2
  - 11:30 - 11:45: Demo 3
  - 11:45 - 12:00: Discussion of ideas for the hackathon

- 12:00 - 13:00: Lunch

- 13:00 - 16:00: Hackathon

- 16:00 - 17:00: Presentations and discussion

# Input datasets

We will use existing input datasets including:

- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
- [Ordnance Survey Open
  Roads](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-roads.html)
- Data from network planning tools, PCT and Network Planning Tool for
  Scotland

Although these datasets are available nationally we will provide subsets
of them for ease of use:

- Small area (e.g. covering LIDA and direct surroundings)
- Medium area (e.g. covering York)
- Large area (e.g. covering Yorkshire and the Humber)

# Outcomes

The hackathon will be an opportunity to develop new tools and ideas for
network generation and analysis. It will also build skills and foster
collaboration between researchers and practitioners in the field.

- Skills development: hackathons are a great way to learn new skills and
  share knowledge.
- New tools and better documentation and understanding
  - Better documentation of existing projects (e.g. NPT)
  - More use cases, identification of bugs and improvements to the tools
- Ideas for future work
  - How the tools can be used in policy
  - Research directions
